NAME
----
reporter-mailx - Sends contents of a problem directory via email.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'reporter-mailx' [-v] -d DIR [-c CONFFILE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads a problem directory, composes an email message
from the directory contents, and uses mailx to send the message to
specified recipient.

Properties of email messages can be specified in a configuration file,
and via environment variables.

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configuration file contains entries in a format "Option = Value".

The options are:

'Subject'::
       The subject of the email message.

'EmailFrom'::
       The sender of the email message.

'EmailTo'::
       The recipient of the email message.

'SendBinaryData'::
       Use yes/true/on/1 to attach all binary files from the dump
       directory to the email. This can cause the emails to be very
       large.

Integration with ABRT events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'reporter-mailx' can be used as a reporter, to allow users report
problems via email when they decide to do it. This usage is
pre-configured in /etc/libreport/events.d/mailx_event.conf:

It can also be used to notify administrator automatically when a
problem happens. When this is desired, modify the event configuration
file to run the tool on the 'post-create' event:

------------
EVENT=post-create       reporter-mailx
------------
