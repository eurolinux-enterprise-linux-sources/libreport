reporter-print(1)
=================

NAME
----
reporter-print - Prints problem information to standard output or FILE.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'reporter-print' [-v] [-d DIR] [-o FILE] [-a yes/no] [-r]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads problem directory DIR and prints its text representation
to stdout or to a specified FILE.

Integration with ABRT events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'reporter-print' can be used as a reporter, to allow users
to report problems by writing them to a file. Example:

------------
EVENT=report  reporter-print -o "${Log_File:-/tmp/abrt.log}"
------------

OPTIONS
-------
-d DIR::
   Path to problem directory.

-v::
   Be more verbose. Can be given multiple times.

-o FILE::
   Output file

-a yes/no::
   If -o FILE is specified, controls whether FILE is appended to, or
   overwritten. (default: no)

-r::
   Add a record to 'reported_to' in DIR which specifies that this
   problem was reported. Some tools use this to differentiate between
   problems which were and weren't yet reported.

Output format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The output is designed to be machine-parsable. The elements which have
only one line are printed in the form

   NAME:<whitespace>VALUE

Elements which have more than one line are printed in the form

   NAME:
   :LINE1
   :LINE2
   :LINE3

Output may contain empty lines for better readability.
